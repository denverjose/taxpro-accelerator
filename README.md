# Taxpro Accelerator (Previous Version)

This is a previous version of the learning platform I built while working for a US client.  
It’s a basic website built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **Supabase**.  

**Live version:** [https://taxproaccelerator.com](https://taxproaccelerator.com)  

## Features
- Modern responsive UI
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Server-side data fetching
- Integration with Supabase for data storage

## Getting Started

This project requires a `.env` file to run properly. The `.env` file contains sensitive information such as API keys and other configuration values.  

**Important:** The `.env` file is **not included** in the repository for security reasons.  

To run the project locally:  
1. Contact me to provide the `.env` file.  
2. Place the `.env` file in the root directory.  
3. Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
