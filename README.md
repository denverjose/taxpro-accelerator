This is a Next.js app from my previos employer I did for
https://taxproaccelerator.com/

## Getting Started

First, do `npm intsall`
then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
