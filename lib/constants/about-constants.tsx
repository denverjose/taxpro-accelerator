            Hi I&apos;m Jose and I&apos;m happily married to my beautiful wife,
            Lucy. I&apos;m a retired Army Veteran born and raised in Ponce, PR.
            I came to the United States looking for better opportunities and
            joined the Army before I graduated high school. I served in the Army
            until I retired in 2011. But the government doesn&apos;t do much to
            prepare us for civilian life and many of us end up in despair. So, I
            was divorced and bankrupt in 2015 but my low point was when my bank
            of 20+ years told me that my money wasn&apos;t good enough for a
            $300 secured credit card.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            I moved to Atlanta in 2017 to be near my daughter and for new
            opportunities. I met Lucy in 2019, she was already in the Tax
            industry and I was still struggling with my Army transition, but
            she&apos;s the daughter of a Navy Veteran and she understood me in a
            way that I didn&apos;t understand myself. I was working on becoming
            a software developer so we started working together, combining our
            skill sets to create something new in the Tax Industry.

            You can get tax software from dozens of providers, but you
            can&apos;t get a reliable business support system where YOU own your
            business. Many providers keep the website and your emails, etc, when
            you leave them. Here at TaxPro YOU own your domain and you can
            transfer your domain, emails, clients, etc. if you leave us. Tax
            Companies enjoy piece of mind since we use bank products so that we
            don&apos;t touch your prep fees. They are deposited straight to your
            account. This is why over 120+ business partners trust us!

            Hi I&apos;m Lucy and I&apos;m happily married to my husband Jose and
            I have two beautiful children who are the reason for my drive and
            perseverance. I&apos;ve been in the Tax industry for over 10yrs and
            have ran my own Tax Software Company for over 7yrs. I started doing
            taxes out of pure necessity. At the time I was in a controlling and
            financially abusive relationship that I wanted to leave desperately.
            I had two children at home, without my own income to support them,
            or a family member that I could go to for help. I worked at building
            my business for years before I finally broke free.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            I was raised in East Point, GA, and I graduated with a degree in
            Exercise Science from Georgia State, Atlanta. I had my sights on
            attending medical School but the lack of support and childcare
            derailed those plans. My first year in college I couldn&apos;t
            afford childcare so I was forced to take my daughter to class with
            me. I didn&apos;t complain, I studied hard, and got accepted into
            the Honors College for high achieving students after just 6 months.
            Due to my academic success, I received a scholarship for my daughter
            that helped with costs at the on campus daycare.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Medical school was no longer a possibility due to the lack of
            support but I saw an opportunity to learn how to do taxes. I grinded
            it out and learned everything I could and started my business in the
            dining room of my adopted mother with 5 dollars in my pocket. Years
            later, when I&apos;m training offices, I tell them &quot;If you
            believe you deserve it, then go get it!&quot;. My children deserved
            a good life and I deserved to not be gaslit every day and broke!
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            You can get tax software from dozens of providers but I guarantee
            none of these people are ME. I bring the experience, the patience
            and the results. I don&apos;t have to brag because the success
            stories speak for themselves. We have a model that is unlike any
            other where you get a reliable business support system where YOU own
            your business outright.
